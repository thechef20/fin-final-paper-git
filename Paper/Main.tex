\section{Introduction and Motivation}
Asset pricing has a long history of models and theories governing how investors make decisions. Over the last decade, investors have become increasingly interested in factors outside of traditional financial metrics when assessing the possibility of an investment's returns. Much of this enthusiasm has been based on an ESG, Environmental Social Governance, framework. ESG investing considers how firms respond to these factors as potential impetuses for excess performance. This increased attention is especially visible in Morgan Stanley's 2019 survey of the ESG landscape. Morgan Stanley  found that 75\% of assessment managers say that "their firm has adopted sustainable investing." Only two years prior, in 2016, just 10\% of surveyed asset managed had adopted sustainable investing, demonstrating the rapid speed of adoption for ESG investing analysis \cite{morgan_stanley_sustainable_2019}. Practitioners have utilized the ESG framework to reduce risk in their investments while also finding abnormal returns.

Global climate change presents a host of possible and sizable financial risks from increased water levels, which could threaten major global cities' safety, including Miami, Honk Konk, and Shanghai, with the potential to displace 100's of millions of people \cite{holder_three-degree_nodate}. Global climate change is also shifting the landscape for global agricultural production as more extreme weather conditions, including droughts, pose problems to the most fundamental building block of economic activity. In addition to risk mitigation, investors look to utilize ESG principle for superior returns. A research report published by McKinsey and Company linked gender diversity on executive teams to higher profitability and superior value creation \cite{mckinsey_diversity}.

In addition to risk investing professionals, ESG investing is appealing to a younger set of investors interested in a plethora of global issues from global climate change to diversity and inclusion in the workplace. A study conducted by Morgan Stanly found that millennials investors were twice as likely as the general investing population to invest in a company with social or environmental goals.

This new wave of investor sentiment has created strong tailwinds for sustainable investment projects. In 2020 alone, fund flows into sustainable funds grew by 51 billion dollars which is up over 100\% for the 2019 fund flow into sustainable investment products of about 21, placing total assets under management in sustainable products at over 250B. Fund flows into sustainable products for 2020 accounted for a little less a quarter of all US mutual fund flow and about one-fifteenth of all ETF fund flow according to morningstar \cite{monring_star_ESG}.

To address the impact of ESG factors on stock preformance, this paper is broken into five sections. \textit{Section \ref{Literature}} will provide a  brief literature review of papers looking at abnormal performance around ESG criteria as well as discussion of asset pricing models to capture ESG factors in performance. Next \textit{ Section \ref{Data}}  will provide a brief discussion of the data used in this paper as well as the data cleaning process and summary statistics. Following the Data, \textit{Section \ref{Methodology}} will breakdown of the methodology for the paper. Finally, \textit{Section \ref{Results}}  will summarize the results of the regressions, \textit{Section \ref{Robustness}} will check the robustness of the results and \textit{Section \ref{Conclusion}} will provide a conclusion and possible extensions for next steps. 

\section{Literature Review}
This section will be broke into two components, we will first look at theoretical models for asset purchasing and then we will introduce some of the mythology for introducing a EGS factor into the asset pricing framework.
to account for the ESG factor of a five factor famma french model, the authers used the S\&P ESG index as the high ESG index and the S\&P petroleum index as the low index creating a facotr by subtracting the retunrs from the high ESG portfolio from the low ESG portfolio. \cite{Gregory2020TheGP}
\label{Literature}

\section{Data}
\label{Data}
The data used for this paper was sourced from three datasets. The daily performance of the individual stock prices was collected from CRSP's primarily daily stock prices. Data on the ESG portfolio and the contra ESG portfolio were extracted from Compustat as the daily returns for the MSCI World ESG Focus Index and S\&P petroleum index, respectively. Finally, daily Fama French factors for SMB, CMA, HML, and RMW were sourced from the Kenneth R. French - Data Library.  



An ESG factor, denoted as EMP (Esg Minus Petroleum), was created by taking the daily returns from the MSCI World ESG Focus Index and subtracting the daily returns for the the  S\&P petroleum index. Petroleum companies act as a stand-in for a contra ESG proflio in a similar way to the what Fama french do to isolate the specific risk component. The  petroleum index was chosen as non renewable energy industry is a exposed to a number of environmental risk factors that are considered substantially in an ESG analysis. In addition, the use of a petroleum index has been used in other academic work as a stand in for a contra ESG portfolio \cite{Frynas2005TheFD}. Although the Petroleum industry has major environmental, risks there is less social orientated risks as the index \$VICE which is an index of alcohol, drug, gaming and betting industry might provide a better exposure to the broad based effects of social ESG risk factors as a contra ESG portfolio. However \$Vice has only traded for two years, as such the data is far less robust. Instead, to check for robustness of the ESG factor and to exposure the contra portfolio to both strong social and environmental risk factors the analysis explained in the methodology will be repeated using the  In addition, in section \ref{Robustness} for robustness I will repeat the analysis replacing the  S\&P petroleum index with S\&P Metals \& Mining Select Industry Index as the contra ESG portfolio for the EMP factor. It has been also well documented that the mining industry also struggles to adapt to ESG factors due to the nature of the industry \cite{Kapelus2002MiningCS}.

\begin{equation}
    \label{making_EMP}
    EMP = R_{\text{World ESG Focus Index}}- R_{\text{S\&P petroleum index}}
\end{equation}

 Data points were collected between June 2011 and March 2021. The started was determined by the initiation of the MSCI ESG index. With the selected window, CRSP data for daily returns were collected on each available company. Daily returns for the individual companies as well as each of the Fama factors and the EMP factor was collapsed by month by summing the daily changes in each given month and year. The collapses resulted in 830,891 observations for 12,194 unique stocks, which gives an average of 68months of data for each unique securityâ€”outlined in table 1are some of the summary statistics for the raw data.

\section{Methodology}
\label{Methodology}
As discussed in the literature review there are numerous different models for assessing asset pricing and abnormal returns. In this paper I will be using an extension on on Fama French's 2015 paper ``A five factor asset pricing model". This method of analysis is builds off of the famma french three factor model and relies on the 2 pass sort with an assign series of beta decile and size decile based portfolios. Breaking the portfolios into these distinct groups allows for further analysis of the effect across these two factors to assess relational interdependency. 

For this analysis I sort each security by month into decile groups for beta as well as size (based on market cap). Each security will be assigned a decile for beta and size according the the CRSP /NYSE american beta decile for beta and the CRSP Nasdaq Market Capitalization portfolio for size. After sorting each of the securities by Beta and size decile  300,264 of the original 830,889 data points had matches for both portfolios. To estimate the factor sensitivities base on the discribed decile groups I ran the regression in equation \eqref{six_factor_basic_reg} on the cleaned data set. 






\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    R_{i,t}^e = a_i+b_i(R_{M,t}-R_{fr,t})+s_iSMB_t+ h_iHML_t+  r_iRMW_t+c_iCMA_t+e_iEMP_t
    \end{split}
    \label{six_factor_basic_reg}
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
Where:\\
    $R_{i,t}^e = R_{it}-R_{rf,t}$
\end{center}

Next, I used the data from equation \eqref{six_factor_basic_reg} to run the second regression in the two pass sort. The second pass of the two pass sort is  described in the equation  \eqref{second_pass} and is used to obtain the risk premia. To consolidate the the risk premium across time a simple average as described in equation \eqref{summing_lamda} is used to collapse the risk premia for each of the given factors. 

\begin{equation}
    E[R^e_{t}]= b_t\lambda_1+s_t\lambda_2 +h_t \lambda_3 +r_t\lambda_4 +c_t \lambda_4 + e_t \lambda_5
    \label{second_pass}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    \frac{1}{T}\sum^T_{t=1}\lambda_{i,t}
    \label{summing_lamda}
\end{equation}
\begin{center}
    where:\\
    T: is equal to the number of months in sample
\end{center}




\section{Results}
\label{Results}
Table 3 in represents a matrix of values for the first pass in the fama french two pass sort, described in equation \eqref{six_factor_basic_reg}. The column axis is the distinct size deciles where 1 is the smallest market cap companies and 10 is the declie with the largest market cap companies. The row axis includes estimated coefficients for the intercept, five Fama French factors and the EMS factor. $HML_{t}$ is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of high and low book to market stocks, $SMB_{t}$ i the return on a diversified portfolio of small stocks minus the return on a diversified portfolio of big stocks, $RMW_t$ is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of stocks with robust and weak profitability,$CMA_{t}$ is the difference between the returns on diversified portfolios of the stocks of low and high investment firms,$EMP_t$ is the difference between MSCI World ESG Focus Index returns and the S\&P petroleum index. Finally, the intercept is the excess returns for the given decile.The results in this table demonstrate that for HML, CMA and EMP factor there is a size based relationship where in the larger the size decile the smaller the effect is on the factor. In addition, the EMP factor also exhibits a  a consistent negative relationship between the EGS factor and returns. This relationship indicates that investors are actually paying a premium to invest in ESG companies over the contra ESG counterparts. Table 4 complements table 3 with a breakdown of significance for each coefficient in table 3. The low p-values in the EMP factor indicate that the coefficients on all but the largest and smallest size deciles are significant at the 5\% level. It is important to note that all of the factors are less significant that largest and small polios indicating that the data might have point at far ends which do not behave like the other deciles.  Moving to table 6 and the second step in the two pass sort we can see the risk premia for each of the factors. All of the Fama French factors in the size decile two pass sort have positive risk premia. The EMP factor large than all of the other factors with a coefficient of approximately  16.8\%

Moving on to the beta decile based two pass sort the reuslts are quite similar to the size decile results. Table 5 details the relationship outlined in equation \eqref{six_factor_basic_reg} in the methodology where the column axis is the beta decile where 1 is the portfolio comprised of the companies with lowest bet and 10 is the portfolio of companies  with the greatest beta values.  Similar to the size decile the EMP factor exhabits a negative relations with regards to its sensitivity. However, unlike the size decile analyis there does not appear to be a signficant relationship between the  beta and the sensitivity of the factor. Although the largest impact is on the lowest decile the least impact is experienced on the 6th decile porfolio and the largest deciel is close to the middle in terms of sensitivity. Similar to the size decile analysis the EMP coefficients are all very significant with every decile having significance at the 5\% level. When considering the second phase of the two pass sort the similarities to the size decile continue where in each of the Fama French five factors exhabit a positive risk premia and the EMP also exhabits a positive relationship. the EMP factor again has the high coefficient with approximately 15.8\%.

To capture abnormal returns we will consider 5 factors that is the 5 factors from the famma french paper small minus big(SMB),CMA, HML, and market portfolio(I.e model, consisting of market, size, value, profitability, and investment factors;). In addition I will ad another term to address how stocks move with the movement to a ESG porlfio. For this purpose we will use the MSCI ESG all world index.
