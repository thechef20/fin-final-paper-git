The data used for this paper was sourced from three datasets. The daily performance of the individual stock prices was collected from CRSP's primarily daily stock prices. Data on the ESG portfolio and the contra ESG portfolio were extracted from Compustat as the daily returns for the MSCI World ESG Focus Index and S\&P petroleum index, respectively. Finally, daily Fama French factors for SMB, CMA, HML, and RMW were sourced from the Kenneth R. French - Data Library.  



An ESG factor, denoted as EMP (Esg Minus Petroleum), was created by taking the daily returns from the MSCI World ESG Focus Index and subtracting the daily returns for the the  S\&P petroleum index. Petroleum companies act as a stand-in for a contra ESG portfolio in a similar way to isolate the specific risk component just to ESG similar to how Fama frech create their factors. The  petroleum index was chosen as non renewable energy industry is a exposed to a number of environmental risk factors that are considered substantially in an ESG analysis. In addition, the use of a petroleum index has been used in other academic work as a stand in for a contra ESG portfolio \cite{Frynas2005TheFD}. Although the Petroleum industry has major environmental, risks there is less social orientated risks in petrolium. One solution to this provlem would be to use the index \$VICE which tracks alcohol, drug, gaming and betting industry  as the  contra ESG portfolio. However \$Vice has only traded for two years, as such the data is far less robust. Instead, to check for robustness of the ESG factor and to exposure the contra portfolio to both strong social and environmental risk factors the analysis explained in the methodology will be repeated using the \& Mining Select Industry Index as the contra ESG portfolio for the EMP factor in Section \ref{Robustness}. It has been also well documented that the mining industry also struggles to adapt to ESG factors due to the nature of the industry as has suffered from many human right violations which would significantly effects its social risk  \cite{Kapelus2002MiningCS}.

    EMP = R_{\text{World ESG Focus Index}}- R_{\text{S\&P petroleum index}}

For this analysis, daily returns data was collected between June 2011 and March 2021. The started was determined by the initiation of the MSCI ESG index. To collect daily individual stock return information CRSP data parsed from a larger data set and then collapsed on month by summing each individual days returns to create monthly returns. Similarly Fama French factors were collected on a daily basis and collapsed by month summing the daily returns for montly figures. Finally the EMP factor was also  constructed summing the daily returns for each much. All three of the datasets were merged using the date and month as the matching component. The culmination of merging and collapsing resulted in  830,891 observations for monthly returns over  12,194 unique stocks. The merged and cleaned dataset had an average of 68 months of data of individual security data for each unique security. Below in table 1 are the summary statistics for the raw data.
